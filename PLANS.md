# PLANS.md — Multi‑hour plans for loopautoma

This file is the long‑lived planning surface for complex or multi‑hour tasks in this repository, following the “Using PLANS.md for multi‑hour problem solving” pattern.

Any LLM agent (Copilot, Cursor, Codex, etc.) working in this repo must:

- Read this file at the start of a substantial task or when resuming work.
- Keep an explicit, checklist‑style plan here for the current task.
- Update the plan and progress sections as work proceeds.
- Record assumptions, decisions, and known gaps so future agents can continue smoothly.

## How to use this file

For each substantial user request or multi‑step feature, create a new **Task** section like this:

```markdown
## Task: <short title>

**User request (summary)**  
- <One or two bullet points capturing the essence of the request.>

**Context and constraints**  
- <Key architecture or rollout constraints from the docs.>

**Plan (checklist)**  
- [ ] Step 1 — ...
- [ ] Step 2 — ...
- [ ] Step 3 — ...

**Progress log**  
- YYYY‑MM‑DD — Started task, drafted plan.  
- YYYY‑MM‑DD — Completed Step 1 (details).  

**Assumptions and open questions**  
- Assumption: ...  
- Open question (only if strictly necessary): ...

**Follow‑ups / future work**  
- <Items that are explicitly out of scope for this task but worth noting.>
```

Guidelines:

- Prefer small, concrete steps over vague ones.
- Update the checklist as you go—do not wait until the end.
- Avoid deleting past tasks; instead, mark them clearly as completed and add new tasks below.
- Keep entries concise; this file is a working log, not polished documentation.

## Active tasks

There is currently no active multi‑hour task recorded here.

When you begin one, create a new **Task** section under this heading and keep it up to date until the work is complete.

## Completed tasks

Add completed tasks here as you finish them, preserving enough detail that a future maintainer can understand what was done and why.
